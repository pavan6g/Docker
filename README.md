This is the repository for the GitHub Actions..

For developer professionals, solving problems is a vital part of the job—particularly solving problems that keep coming up. GitHub Actions will let you automate your repetitive problems away, and in this course—created in partnership with GitHub—Ray Villalobos shows you how to set them up to tackle real-world projects. Ray starts with the basics of Actions, going over what you can do with them and how they work. He then shows you the steps necessary to publish a marketplace action, including creating a workflow, a generator repo Dockerfile, entry point, and action.yml file. Finally, Ray takes you through testing and releasing your GitHub Action.

If you’re a developer looking to advance your career, or a recent computer science grad searching for a developer role, check out this course to learn practical skills to add your portfolio and enhance your standing in a competitive job market.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
